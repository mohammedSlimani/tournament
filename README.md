## System description
This is a system that manages the football tournaments in my school. 
There is a responsible who will anounce a new tournament and the captains of the teams who are interested in the tournament will register their teams. The app should automaticlly make the tournament groups and match each team with an adversary. After the end of each match, the Responsible should enter the result manually and the tournament will then progress.

## Architectural pattern choice
I have chosen to go with the Layerd architecture pattern. I am interested in the separation of concern and I would like to change some of the technologies I am using in the future. 

## Design pattern
Even thoght I have read that MVC is no longer a good design pattern (https://cirw.in/blog/time-to-move-on). I have to see for myself the limitations of this design pattern so I can get a good grasp of why I should be considering using other design patterns, for example : MOVE ( Models, Operations, Views, Events.).
